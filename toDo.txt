Things to be done: 001. Figure out how to send data to HS and its data structures

1. Figure out how to send data to your code
2. How to host API end point somewhere so that we can send data to it from the code on sandbox.io

How to send data to the API?
In the form of a JSON object.
Every time the next button is clicked, we will create a JSON object with the relevant values and pass it to the API.
The API will refer to the object and send it directly to HS.
How the the mapping of property will happen is by specifying the exact property name as the key for the values

But how will it know who this data belongs to?

We will use the CREATE API for when we have email.
And post that we will use the UPDATE API with the email as the identifier.
